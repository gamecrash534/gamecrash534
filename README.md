### About 
Two of my probably most loved hobbies would be coding and gaming. Atleast thats what I would say.
So, what languages do I code with and what do I play for games?
Here is a small table, down there will be a better overview for coding:
|Languages| Games |
|--|--|
| HTML5, CSS3, JS | Minecraft 
|C# | Satisfactory
| Python, Lua[-u]| CSGO // TF2
| Arduino lang (between C++ and C)| Asphalt 9: Legends
